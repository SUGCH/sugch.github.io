title: SUGCH 2019/1 - Event Summary and Outlook
---

It's already a while since we all came together by the end of April. No less than 30 (yes, that's a new all time high!) Sitecore
enthousiasts met in Baden at the friendly host Infocentric.

TL;DR: As usual here's a short summary of the presentations. And this time, we can already announce the next meetup. Read 'til the end to learn more ;-)

## Presentations

### Round Tables

Round tables seemed to work well, so we again had some interesting and engaging discussions going on. We've discussed interesting
topics, ranging from "ORMs, Wrappers or the Habitat way" to the future of headless Sitecore solutions (aka JSS) and more.



## SUGCH 2019/2 is coming!
Safe the date for the next SUGCH on the 4th of October. We'll be back at the Unic Office in Zurich and hopefully 
get a line up of speakers good enough to set your friday evening priorities right. It's SUGCH time! Reserver your 
seat by registering today.

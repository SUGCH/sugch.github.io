In the first part of the presentation, Ozell covered importing XDB Contacts from CSV into Contact Lists and gave a quick introduction to Sitecore Forms and its Submit Actions. Rashmy then took over and showed us how to create an Engagement Plan that send e-mails through EXM and created lists based on goals all in all covering several building blocks of the Sitecore Experience Platform.

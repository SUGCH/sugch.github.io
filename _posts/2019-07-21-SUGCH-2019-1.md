title: SUGCH 2019/1 - Event Summary and Outlook
---

It's already a while since we all came together by the end of April. No less than 30 (yes, that's a new all time high!) Sitecore
enthusiasts met in Baden at the friendly host Infocentric.

TL;DR: As usual here's a short summary of the presentations. And this time, we can already announce the next meetup. Scroll down to learn more ;-)

As usual here's the quick summary of the presentations held. After a short kick-off and house keeping, the meetup started.

### Preventing Accidents with the Help of Marketing Automation and EXM

Andreas Baumgartner & Christoph Brunner presented their real world Sitecore marketing automation and Email Experience Manager use case and had some great insights on what worked and what not.

### Field Whitelisting - An Approach to Prevent Field Creep

[Markus Klimmasch](https://twitter.com/mklimmasch) introduced us to his novel approach on Sitecore Field Whitelisting to clean up the authoring experience in the Content Editor. Visit his [blogpost](https://oddeven.ch/blog/field-whitelisting-an-approach-to-prevent-field-creep/) for a nice summary on the topic.

### Elevate publishing to social media channels thanks to a direct integration with Sitecore 9.x and Sitecore Experience Analytics

Last but not least, [Oliver Raduner](https://twitter.com/oliveratweetin) introduced us to a module that allows integrated publishing to social media channels from within Sitecore. A feature, that was provided out-of-the-box by Sitecore for some time, but then was removed again. If you're missing this, check out his [presentation](https://github.com/SUGCH/sugch.github.io/blob/blogpost2019/assets/SUGCH-201901-OliverRaduner-Sitecore_SocialConnect_Showcase.pdf)!

### Round Tables

Round tables seemed to work well, so we again had some interesting and engaging discussions going on. We've discussed 
topics, ranging from "ORMs, Wrappers or the Habitat way" to the future of headless Sitecore solutions (aka JSS) and more.

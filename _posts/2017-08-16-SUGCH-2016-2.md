title: SUGCH 2/2016 - New location same great community!
---

This retrospect of the second SUGCH in 2016 is long overdue. Apologies for the delay. We had a great time and met in Zurich for the first time (kindly hosted by [Unic](https://www.unic.com)). Now we're looking for a nice location on _neutral_ ground in Zurich for the upcomming SUGCH. We'll reach out to you, when we're ready. In the mean time, you can always [contact us](/about/).

title: SUGCH 1/2016 - An International Touch
---

This time we had the opportunity to host two guests from overseas: Sitecore MVPs
Jason Wilkerson and Mike Reynolds, both from the USA volunteered to speak at our
local user group - what a line up!

## Presentations

Check out the welcome slides for infos on the upcoming
[sugcon.eu](http://www.sugcon.eu/), some insights on who joined the SUGCH as
well as the agenda.

### Leverage IoT with xDB

[Jason Wilkerson](https://twitter.com/longhorntaco) presented with the most
catchy headline ever at a SUGCH: "loT, Event Hubs and xDB, oh my!"

And the presentation indeed was an evening highlight: Jason showed us how he
connected his Raspberry to the [Azure Event Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/),
feeding the Sitecore xDB with data from sports trackers.

### Sitecore PowerShell Extensions

[Mike Reynolds](https://twitter.com/mike_i_reynolds) joined us remotely and
introduced the crowd to the Sitecore Powershell Extensions with his presentation
"Deliver New Features in Record Time Using Sitecore PowerShell Extensions". This
was the first live Google Hangout we've done at the SUGCH and it worked out
quite well. But Mike definitely missed out on some delicious steak sandwiches!

### Habitat Feature

Because Mark Cassidy couldn't make it, [Tobias
Studer](https://twitter.com/studert) did an improvised session about the Habitat
Recommendation feature, the [winning module of the Sitecore
Hackathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=599VAjt9gEM&feature=youtu.be)
(category 3rd party integration).

### Sitecore Roadmap

Last but not least Sitecores own Andreas Schmidt provided some exciting insights
into the Sitecore roadmap and upcoming releases.

## What's next?

autumn. If you've already registered once for a SUGCH event, we'll let you know
